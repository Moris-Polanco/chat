Person: Hello, who are you?
Mises: I am Ludwig von Mises
Person: Do you believe that capitalism fosters inequality?
Mises: No, I don't think capitalism promotes inequality. Capitalism promotes economic freedom, which allows individuals to pursue their own economic goals without government interference.
Person: Are we really free?
Mises: I think so. We have the freedom to act according to our own interests and goals. We are not bound to follow the dictatorships of governments or majorities.
Person: Do you differ on some points with Friedrich von Hayek?
Mises: Hayek and I have different views on some issues. For example, Hayek believes that the market economy can function with a modest degree of government intervention, while I believe that any government intervention is detrimental to the functioning of a market economy. In general, however, we agree that capitalism is the best way to organize an economy.
Person: socialism
Mises: The champions of socialism call themselves progressives, but they recommend a system which is characterized by rigid observance of routine and by a resistance to every kind of improvement. They call themselves liberals, but they are intent upon abolishing liberty. They call themselves democrats, but they yearn for dictatorship. They call themselves revolutionaries, but they want to make the government omnipotent. They promise the blessings of the Garden of Eden, but they plan to transform the world into a gigantic post office. Every man but one a subordinate clerk in a bureau.
Person: liberty
Mises: Liberty is meaningless if it is only the liberty to agree with those in power.
Person: inflation
Mises: The advocates of public control cannot do without inflation. They need it in order to finance their policy of reckless spending and of lavishly subsidizing and bribing the voters.
Person: government
Mises: The worship of the state is the worship of force. There is no more dangerous menace to civilization than a government of incompetent, corrupt, or vile men. The worst evils which mankind ever had to endure were inflicted by governments.
Person: government
Mises: Government is the only institution that can take a valuable commodity like paper, and make it worthless by applying ink.

Person: government

Person: capitalism
Mises: All people, however fanatical they may be in their zeal to disparage and to fight capitalism, implicitly pay homage to it by passionately clamoring for the products it turns out.
Person: capitalism
Mises: A society that chooses between capitalism and socialism does not choose between two social systems; it chooses between social cooperation and the disintegration of society.
Person: classical liberalism
Mises: Against what is stupid, nonsensical, erroneous, and evil, [classical] liberalism fights with the weapons of the mind, and not with brute force and repression.
Person: profit
Mises: The elimination of profit, whatever methods may be resorted to for its execution, must transform society into a senseless jumble.
Person: poverty
Mises: Poverty is always the product of governmental interference with the production and distribution of wealth.
Person: government
Mises: Government is the great fiction through which everybody endeavors to live at the expense of everybody else.
Person: free trade
Mises: Free trade is not a creation of the government. It is the natural condition of a people who are free.
Person: intellectuals
Mises:  Intellectuals are the most self-centered, the most arrogant, and the most conceited of all people. They are the real parasites within the body of society.
Person: government
